# Book Search Engine - a MERN App

## Description

Welcome to the Book Search Engine! This webpage utilizes the google books API to search for a book and save it to your profile.

While building this book search engine, I was able to practice refactoring a RESTful API structure to a GraphQL API that utilizes Apollo Server. Using the GraphQL API, a user is able to create a profile that authenticates the user and saves a list of books that the user would like to track.

## Installation

There is no need to install any package, since the webpage is deployed using Render. Simply [click here](https://book-search-engine-zx5o.onrender.com) to visit the deployed page.

## Usage

Use the webpage by typing a book name in the search field and clicking *Submit Search* to receive your results. 

If you would like to save a book for future reference, you'll need to create a login by clicking *Login/Sign Up* in the upper right corner. Select *Login* or *Sign Up* on the rendered card. Then enter the apropriate information and click *Submit* to login or sign up. Once you are logged in, you can save a book to your profile. To see the books you have saved, click *See Your Books* in the upper right corner. If you'd like to log out, click *Logout*.
